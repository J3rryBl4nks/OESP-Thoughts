# OSEP-Thoughts
My thoughts from going through the OSEP materials.


##OSEP PDF##

The OSEP PDF covers a large breadth of materials with surprising depth. The techniques can mostly be found elsewhere but the OSEP materials aggregate them all into one place with in depth explanations of why the techniques work.

The level of detail and explanation is intense, just like you would expect from Offsec. All of the popular tools were mentioned and explained but there was also a lot of custom code written to help you understand why the exploits work the way they do.

I would say that this course is a must-have for anyone who does penetration testing at any level.

## CAVEAT ##
I did not do the labs that were exploit vectors that I have done in the past. I will be circling back to them because I want to implement them in the way that Offsec describes, but I had exeperience with quite a few of the exploit vectors that were covered.

Further thoughts on the labs and videos are forthcoming.
