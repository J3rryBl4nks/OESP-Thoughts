### Lab 1 ###

Lab 1 is a not gentle introduction lab. The way to get the initial compromise is right in front of you, but is not an easy task. Once you get past the hurdles
and do some enum, the path is clear to domain admin. -- Completed

### Lab 2 ###

Lab 2 is all about connecting the dots for yourself. The initial exploit and pivots don't try to hide. -- Completed


### Lab 3 ###

Lab 3 is out of my comfort zone. You are presented with a fairly straightforward path to the initial compromise on all three of the servers. Local.txt shouldn't take long. Root access on this lab is a matter of doing enum and understanding the steps required.
