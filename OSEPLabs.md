The OSEP Challenge labs are scenario based labs that give you a simulated network to practice your newly-found skills in.

Labs 1 - 3 are geared to teach you a specific exploit vector.
Labs 4 - 6 are designed to simulate real networks and give you an opportunity to practice your enumeration skills to find your attack paths.


The labs do NOT contain trolling or CTF type challenges.
